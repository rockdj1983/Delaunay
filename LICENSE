C# implementation by Ondrej Svejdar. C# port is initialy based on java implementation
by Connor Clark (www.hotengames.com).

Pretty much a 1:1 translation of a wonderful map generating algorthim by Amit Patel of Red Blob Games,
which can be found here (http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/)
Hopefully it's of use to someone out there who needed it in C# like I did!
Note, the only island mode implemented is Radial. Implementing more is something for another day.

FORTUNE'S ALGORITHM

This is a C# implementation of an algorthim
originally created in C++. Pretty much a 1:1 translation to C#, save
for some necessary workarounds. Original as3 implementation by Alan Shaw (of nodename)
can be found here (https://github.com/nodename/as3delaunay). Original algorthim
by Steven Fortune (see license for c++ implementation below)
